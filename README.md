EPROM is also known as erasable programmable ROM(read-only memory). It allows stored data to be erased and new data to be loaded. 
It provides considerable flexibility during the development phase of the digital system. 
It can retain information for a long time during the digital system's development phase. That's why it can be used in place of ROM while software is being developed. This allows for easy memory changes and updates. 
EPROMâ€™s structure is similar to ROM. 
An important advantage is that the EPROM chip can be erased and reprogrammed by exposing it to ultraviolet light. For this, EPROM chips are mounted in packages with transparent windows.

Key features or advantages of EPROM 
Erasable and reprogrammed: 
Non-Volatile: Data is retained even when power is off. 
Programmable: by EPROM programmer or burner ( it is programmed using a special device )


Uses of EPROM

1 Firmware storage ( like BIOS in computers(basic input and output systems), which control hardware and software in computers, 
and microcontrollers)

2. Prototyping allows updates and changes. ( It can retain information for a long time during the development phase of the digital system, which is why it can be used in place of ROM while software is being developed. This allows for easy memory changes and updates.)

3 Legacy systems: for storing game data and system software (which was used in older computers and gaming consoles).

EPROM work 
1 programming: by the EPROM programmer  ( which applies high voltage signals to write data to the memory cell of the EPROM)
2 Erasing: by UV light (to erase the data, we have to expose the chip to ultraviolet light by mounting transparent windows.)

Disadvantages of EPROM
UV light erasure ( which is time-consuming, more than 15 minutes).
Limited number of erase/program cycles (100/1000 cycles).
